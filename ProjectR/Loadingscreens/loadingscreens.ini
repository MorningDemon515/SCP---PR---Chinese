[SCP-005]
image path = ..\ProjectR\Loadingscreens\005.jpg
align x = center
align y = center
disablebackground = true
text1 = SCP-005 resembles an ornate key, displaying the characteristics of a typical mass produced key used in the 1920s.
text2 = SCP-005 seems to have the unique ability to open any and all forms of lock, be they mechanical or digital, with relative ease. The origin of this ability has yet to be determined.
text3 = While SCP-005 has been shown to be effective in removing almost any form of locking device, further experiments have shown that efforts to disguise the purpose or identity of a lock have proven at least somewhat successful in defeating SCP-005's ability.

[SCP-009]
image path = ..\ProjectR\Loadingscreens\009.jpg
align x = right
align y = top
disablebackground = true
text1 =  SCP-009 is approximately 3,700 liters of a substance which exhibits a number of unique properties. While small amounts of the substance, in all phases, are as colorless as mundane water, en masse it takes on a distinct deep red hue.
text2 = Its most notable property, however, is the fact that SCP-009's reaction to temperature extremes is exactly opposite that of standard H2O: the subject assumes a liquid phase at temperatures between -100°C and 0°C, and converts into a solid state above those temperatures. At temperatures below -100°C, SCP-009 vaporizes into a gaseous phase similar to steam, though it still retains its red coloration when put under high pressure.
text3 = If the subject comes in contact with any biological source of heat, it begins a runaway reaction in which the living organism's bodily fluids are rapidly converted to SCP-009 and promptly frozen by their own body heat (because of their generally high core temperatures, mammals are particularly susceptible).

[SCP-038]
image path = ..\ProjectR\Loadingscreens\038.jpg
align x = right
align y = bottom
text1=SCP-038 was at first thought to be a common apple tree. However, upon closer inspection, it became apparent that SCP-038 was growing things other than apples and, in fact, other than fruit.
text2=SCP-038 has the ability to clone any object that touches its bark. Objects begin growing almost instantaneously and reach maturity within a matter of minutes.
text3=Human and animal cloning through SCP-038 is not recommended, as they appear to age quickly. The majority of these clones live, on average, two (2) weeks.

[SCP-087-B]
image path = ..\ProjectR\Loadingscreens\087.jpg
align x = center
align y = center
disablebackground = true
text1=SCP-087-B is a building with highly unusual properties. When two or more subjects enter SCP-087-B, it appears to be an empty unlit room with concrete walls and a large metal door.
text2=Subjects who have entered SCP-087-B alone have described seeing a dark brick-walled hallway at the wall opposite to the door via radio.
text3=Radio signals seem to weaken extremely fast inside SCP-087-B and radio communication with the subjects becomes impossible when they have entered the hallway. Attempts to re-establish radio contact after losing the signal have failed.

[SCP-113]
image path = ..\ProjectR\Loadingscreens\113.jpg
align x = center
align y = center
disablebackground = true
text1 = SCP-113 resembles a small, polished piece of red jasper. Analysis shows that SCP-113 is not composed of jasper, but [REDACTED] composition similar to that of other recovered objects.
text2 = When SCP-113 comes in direct contact with the flesh of an organism possessing sex chromosomes, the organism's physical characteristics associated with gender and biological sex are transformed (including genetics and secondary sexual characteristic), either reversed or altered.

[SCP-131]
image path = ..\ProjectR\Loadingscreens\131.jpg
align x = center
align y = center
disablebackground = true
text1 = SCP-131-A and SCP-131-B are a pair of teardrop-shaped creatures roughly 30 cm (1 ft) in height, with a single blue eye in the middle of their bodies. SCP-131-A is burnt orange in color while SCP-131-B is mustard yellow.
text2= The subjects can move surprisingly fast, covering over 60 m (200 ft) in a matter of seconds. However, it lacks a braking system, which has led to some rather spectacular, if not overly amusing, mishaps involving the creatures.
text3 = The subjects seem to respond well to any affection given to them and will quickly bond to the giver of said affection, much in the same way a puppy bonds with a human being. They will follow anyone or anything they've made a bond with anywhere, even into normally restricted areas. Although curious, the subjects can sense danger in their general vicinity, and if the object of their bond begins to approach something they register as dangerous. They will swarm around their bonded companion's feet (or appropriate extremities) while babbling in a panicked tone, as if to warn them.

[SCP-148]
image path = ..\ProjectR\Loadingscreens\148.jpg
align x = center
align y = center
disablebackground = true
text1 = SCP-148 is a metallic substance, composed of a variety of known and unknown elements. 
text2 = SCP-148 has shown the ability to block or otherwise hinder extrasensory mind-affecting properties of living organisms in proximity to it.
text3 = This effect, while difficult to quantify, appears inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the subject to SCP-148’s surface and directly proportional to the quantity of SCP-148 in consideration.

[SCP-173-J]
image path = ..\ProjectR\Loadingscreens\173-J.jpg
align x = right
align y = bottom
disablebackground = true
text1 = SCP-173-J is constructed from concrete and rebar with traces of Krylon brand spray paint, as well as what appears to be state-fair-grade water-based face paint in a "cat face" pattern. It is animate and extremely playful.
text2 = The object cannot move while within a direct line of sight. Object is reported to initiate interaction by standing uncomfortably close to subjects.
text3 = Some personnel have reported low, asthmatic-sounding sniffling noises; these are presumed to be imaginary, or memetic, or something. SCP-173-J's primary motive seems to be seeking attention.

[SCP-178]

image path = ..\ProjectR\Loadingscreens\178.jpg

align x = left

align y = top

disablebackground = true

text1 = SCP-178 is a pair of white stereoscopic ("3-D") glasses with a rectangular white cardboard frame and lenses of transparent blue and red (left and right lenses, respectively) plastic. The item exhibits no unusual physical properties apart from a slight discoloration of the cardboard consistent with age.

text2 = When worn, the wearer begins perceiving large bipedal entities in addition to its ordinary surroundings. Entities reportedly exhibit a docile and occasionally curious behavior, with one exception.

text3 = Any attempt by the wearer or any other personnel to directly interact with the entities results in severe lacerations suddenly appearing on persons involved.

[SCP-249]
image path = ..\ProjectR\Loadingscreens\249.jpg
align x = center
align y = center
disablebackground = true
text1 = SCP-249 appears to be a windowless door, covered in a faded white paint. It was first found in a house located within the small town of [REDACTED].
text2 = When opened, SCP-249 does not lead to the other side of the doorway, but to a random door within eight hundred and fifty (850) meters. Items that go through SCP-249 are teleported to that other door, regardless of what may be between the door and SCP-249. When observed from the destination, the exit door appears to open on its own accord, and whatever goes through SCP-249 appears out of thin air. When opened, SCP-249 takes on the appearance of the door it is connected to. When shut, SCP-249 is no longer connected to that door, and reverts to its standard appearance.
text3 = However, roughly every five hundred (500) uses, SCP-249 does not connect to a door within its range, but instead to a random location anywhere in the world, even locations with no apparent doors within hundreds of kilometers. When the 500-use mark approaches, common use of SCP-249 is stopped and tests are done to record its exit location. Since its discovery, a log has been kept documenting these cases.

[SCP-409]
image path = ..\ProjectR\Loadingscreens\409.jpg
align x = center
align y = bottom
disablebackground = true
text1 = SCP-409 resembles a large quartz crystal approximately 1.5m (5ft) tall and 0.6m (2ft) wide.
text2 = Any objects coming in contact with SCP-409 will begin to crystallize.
text3 = After complete crystallization, the object will begin to make snapping and creaking noises for approximately twenty minutes, before bursting into thousands of fragments with great force.

[SCP-484]
image path = ..\ProjectR\Loadingscreens\484.jpg
align x = center
align y = center
disablebackground = true
text1 = SCP-484 is a pharmaceutical of unknown origin originally discovered in use as a street drug in urban areas throughout the world.
text2 = Unlike most street drugs, all samples of SCP-484 are nearly chemically identical. Most illegal drugs vary by manufacturer and contain impurities and additives, but other than cosmetic appearance, SCP-484 samples are identical. 
text3 = When ingested, SCP-484 is absorbed and causes the brain to produce a chemical compound previously unknown. The compound is extremely volatile and breaks down almost immediately if extracted from the brain. Subjects experience rapidly increasing brain activity and pupil dilation.

[SCP-538]
image path = ..\ProjectR\Loadingscreens\538.jpg
align x = center
align y = center
disablebackground = true
text1 = SCP-538 appears to be animate shadows of an unknown species of spiders. SCP-538 appears to "feed" off of the shadows of other living objects, and will move to the nearest shadow cast by a living organism.
text2 = To "feed", SCP-538 does no more than attach itself to the shadow of its host in such a manner that its own shadow is not obscured. Through this manner, a single specimen of SCP-538 can grow up to approximately 15 square centimeters in size. Feeding after this point appears to simply maintain this size; the whole process has so far proven to be harmless to the host. While a specimen can attach itself to an inanimate object to feed, it will slowly atrophy and decrease in size over time. Only when connected to the shadow of a living organism can SCP-538 thrive.
text3 = SCP-538 has shown itself capable of going short distances through open, well lit areas, such as to reach a nearby host or to escape a source of agitation. However, it will rapidly decrease in size at a rate of nearly 2 square centimeters per second for the length of time it is not attached to a shadow. Should a specimen be stranded out in the open long enough, it will eventually decrease to nothing, at which point it can be considered deceased.

[SCP-1026-RU]
image path = ..\ProjectR\Loadingscreens\1026-RU.jpg
align x = center
align y = center
disablebackground = true
text1 = SCP-1026-RU looks like a black humanoid figure with no distinctive age and gender characteristics. Its height measures approximately 191 cm, weight varies from 30 to 70 kg. Its facial features are extremely hypertrophic: the eyes are red ovals, emitting a small glow, the mouth - a wide white "smile", changing the size of the conversation. The nose, ears and hair are absent. The object is able to change its form in a limited way depending on the mood, situation or necessity - practically any part of its body can be subject to such a transformation.
text2 = Despite the fact that SCP-1026 is not ethereal, it is able to absorb visible light rays through the surface of the body and move through minor obstacles such as tables, chairs, pedestals, etc. However, the subject is not able to pass through walls, doors and other structures above human growth, he said, because he does not see where he is going. The theory was confirmed during the tests, when SCP-1026 only with insignificant difficulties passed through the glass and transparent plastic. Also, the subject is not invulnerable, because he reacts to injury and claims to feel pain.
text3 = When in visual contact with a person, the subject falls into a state of aggression, in which he seeks to offend, injure or otherwise cause significant harm to the victim. The appearance of SCP-1026 also changes: the fingers extend 2.5 times and become extremely sharp at the ends; eyes emit a stronger glow, capable for a few seconds to blind the victim; the mouth is a distorted smile with a series of pointed teeth, similar to the teeth of a tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) . During [DATA EXPUNGED] seconds, the subject will spew curses, then attack the victim and injure her, most often while trying to damage the eyes, spine and [REDACTED]. So far, no deaths have been reported on contact with the subject, but all victims describe the harm they caused as [DATA EXPUNGED].

[SCP-1074]
image path = ..\ProjectR\Loadingscreens\1074.jpg
align x = center
align y = center
disablebackground = true
text1 = SCP-1074 is a portrait-sized oil painting on canvas, produced by an unidentified artist. When photographed or videotaped, the entirety of SCP-1074 appears to be painted a uniform shade of gray, with distinctly visible brush strokes.
text2 = When SCP-1074 is viewed by a human being, the observer immediately begins to exhibit physiological symptoms similar to the onset of Stendhal syndrome, including increased heart rate, sweating, and vertigo.
text3 = The individual viewing SCP-1074 will attempt to vividly describe the image they are seeing to anyone present, frequently describing it as the greatest or most moving work of art they have ever seen.

[SCP-1079]
image path = ..\ProjectR\Loadingscreens\1079.jpg
align x = right
align y = bottom
disablebackground = true
text1 = SCP-1079 is the designation given to a number of sweets brightly labelled "Dr. Wondertainment's Bubblebath Bonbons!®". The label on each packet provides the name of the product, and two warnings; "Not suitable for children under 3 years", and "Only one sweet is to be taken per sitting".
text2 = Human subjects report tingling sensations immediately after the consumption of SCP-1079. Ten to fifteen seconds later, the subject's own blood is secreted as pink, bubblegum-scented foam from the subject's pores on their abdomen, arms and back. The total volume of blood secreted in this way is typically from 30-50 mL and does not pose an immediate health risk.
text3 = The volume of blood secreted increases exponentially as more pieces are consumed; bubbles form in the person's blood as a consequence of the SCP's intended function, causing the subject's blood to boil. Death by exsanguination occurs in 95% of subjects who have consumed 4 or more candies in one sitting. Exsanguination is compounded by foam collecting in the lungs of the consumer. After standardized animal testing was conducted, it was found that SCP-1079's effect scales with the consumer's body mass.
