'Project Resurrection' Team Presents...

SCP - CONTAINMENT BREACH: PROJECT RESURRECTION

THANK YOU FOR DOWNLOADING SCP:CB - 'PROJECT RESURRECTION' MOD!

It is RECOMMENDED to read everything. :)

What is 'Project Resurrection'?:

SCP - Containment Breach: Project Resurrection (formerly known as More SCPs/SCPs Mod) is a compilation, "revival" and an add-on mod comprises of discontinued popular mods such as 'Box of Horrors' and 'Fan Breach' with new additional contents (SCPs, etc.) that belongs to 'Project Resurrection' as well as some of the unused 'SCP - Containment Breach' data that were left in the game files.

Prior to V.0.3.0 (V.0.2.5 technically), new contents belonging to 'Project Resurrection' are added.

'Project Resurrection' might receive its own trailer. The concept of the trailer is likely to feature a few implemented SCPs with a preview of one SCP that will make its debut in V.0.5.0a.

We have our own ModDB page as well.
"http://www.moddb.com/mods/scpcb-project-resurrection-mod"

What started 'Project Resurrection'?:

On September 24th 2015, I uploaded a video called "Scp Containment Breach(v.1.2.3): Testing Scps-005" (Actual title of the video and is still up on YouTube). The thought of creating 'Project Resurrection' didn't occur to me until August 12th 2016. Since 'Box of Horrors' was officially discontinued, I came up with an idea that it would be great if I revive the mod under the name of 'SCPs Mod'. At first, the initial plan was to only port 'Box of Horrors' to the game's latest version but I came across 'Fan Breach' while surfing through UndertowGames forum, which was in the state of being discontinued. Eventually, I released the mod in August 15th 2016 with an early title that was later changed to 'More SCPs Mod' before finally changing the name to 'Project Resurrection' for good. There's a reason why it was named 'Project Resurrection'.

Project would mean "development" or "plan" in other ways while "resurrection" is bringing a thing back to life.

--- Biltz3D Engine Performance ---
As of V.0.4.0a and below, it can predominantly cause game breakings (E.g. Lags (FPS drop), flickering rooms).

For the current solution, it would be Happy64Jammer's 4GB Patch. From V.0.4.0a, the mod will include an optimized .exe.

This, however, will be temporary as there will be new function implemented in future versions. The optimized version may include graphical glitches.

--- Too Many SCPs ---
In V.0.5.0, the title of the version is "Too Many SCPs" (If you did not look into the changelog).

I guess it's to commerate the original title of the mod "More SCPs Mod"?

V.0.5.0 will split into four parts: A, B, C, and D

Each parts will include either four or three new SCPs.

With this, this is the first mod to ever include a large number amound of SCPs.

--- Compliation Mod ---
"Collaborating" isn't a right word to say. We have received permissions from Third Subvision Team Leader ENDSHN and Vane Brain to merge our mod with theirs, to add
more content. However, we do not have a finalized name.

As of now, there are several titles for the future compilation mod. Temporary:

Temporary Names:

Secure, Contain, Protect - Containment Breach: Complete Collection (SCP - CB: Complete Collection)
Secure, Contain, Protect - Containment Breach: Escape Or Die
Secure, Contain, Protect - Containment Breach: Massacre Endangerment
Secure, Contain, Protect - Containment Breach: (The) Unseen Nightmares
Secure, Contain, Protect - Project NTF
Secure, Contain, Protect - Project X NTF
Secure, Contain, Protect - NTF's Resurrection

(As a matter of fact, there's a lot of grammatical errors in this text file. Albeit, I'm improving little by little.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Answers with honest opinion)

- Will you add SCP-682?
-- I do not know that question. The answer to it is no. Or maybe...

- SCP-001's purpose is inaccurate compared to the wiki database.
-- It already happened in Fan Breach and besides, there's an endless amount of series continuing on. Think about it, Omni Key Card. It's non-canon.

- I can't find any of those SCPs added into the mod.
- That's weird. Did you click the right executable? Try teleporting to the room and re-generate another map seed. If this problem persists, report the bug to the mod topic.

- Can you please add SCP-XXXX?
-- Maybe or maybe not. You would need to wait.

* SCP-005 is randomly set to any of these locations:
- SCP-005's Containment Chamber
- SCP-???'s Containment Chamber
