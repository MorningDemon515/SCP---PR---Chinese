/
	I would like to thank everyone who have played this mod with little or much 
    support given to me!
    Without your encouragement, this mod wouldn't have gone too far and instead end 
    off with Fan Breach and Box Of Horrors. And with a horrible mod title...
    Project Resurrection still has a long way to go. It may be a mod that is slowly
    updated over a period of time but eventually it will be well-known to many people like
    Box Of Horrors and Nine Tailed Fox Mod.
        
    And again, I would like to thank everyone who has been supporting me for all these years.
    Do look forward for future updates with more content!
 
	Signing off,
